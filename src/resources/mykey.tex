Subject: This is my PGP Key

title: !

Thank you for your PGP public key. This is my PGP public key.
To use the encrypted messages you must do the following:
Send messages to the server as usual. The subject must be the word PGP.
The commands must be put in the first line of the message.
Avoid using attachments for server messages.
The server will always respond with an encrypted PGP message.
