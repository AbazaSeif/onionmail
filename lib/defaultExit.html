<h1>This is a Tor/OnionMail Exit/Enter SMTP Router</h1>
<p>Most likely you are accessing this website because you had some issue with
the traffic coming from this IP/Hosname. This router is part of the 
<a href="http://www.onionmail.info/">OnionMail Project</a> and is also
connected to <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a>, which is
dedicated to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview">providing
privacy</a> to people who need it most: average computer users. This
router IP should be generating no other traffic, unless it has been
compromised.</p>
<p>
Tor sees use by <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers">many
important segments of the population</a>, including whistle blowers,
journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive
censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law
enforcement, just to name a few.  While Tor is not designed for malicious
computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends.
In reality however, the actual amount of 
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse">abuse</a> is quite low. This
is largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to
privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals
can and do <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_tools.html">build,
sell, and trade</a> far larger and 
<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_distributing_your.html">more
powerful networks</a> than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this
operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private,
anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are
almost always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by
extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.</p>

<p>
In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a
network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet
backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers
explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of
a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination
of a given transmission.</p>

<p>
As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track
the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor
traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or
illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).  Attempts to
seize this router will accomplish nothing.</p>

<p>
If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being
used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or
contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure
maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their
equipment, in accordance with 
<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000512----000-.html">DMCA
"safe harbor" provisions</a>. In other words, you will have just as much luck
sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-dmca-response">EFF's prepared
response</a> for more information on this matter.</p>

<p><b>This is an OnionMail enter/exit router:</b><br>
OnionMail is an open source mail router between tor network and internet. 
OnionMail uses filesystem with strong cryptography and some extended functions. 
This server also allows you to use the email in the tor network without losing the 
ability to communicate with the Internet.
</p>
<p><b>Dealing with unwanted messages with X-Notice headers:</b><br>
In the eventuality of unwanted messages with X-Notice headers, contact the <b>SysOp</b> immediately.<br>
<br>You can always contact him at these addresses:
<br>Within the Internet: You can find the address in the X-Notice header. It usually is in the form 
sysop.<span class="gr">xyz.onion</span>@domain.tld
where <span class="gr">xyz.onion</span> is the OnionMail server and domain.tld is an internet address 
of the entry node Within Tor:
<br>sysop@<span class="gr">xyz.onion</span>
<br><div class="evid"><b>OWNERS AND/OR ADMINISTRATORS OF THE ENTRY/EXIT NODE CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ROUTING AND FOR THE MESSAGES BEING SENT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE USER CAN SELECT MULTIPLE EXIT NODES AND HENCE 
CHANGE THE ADDRESS AFTER THE "@" CHARACTER WITHOUT THE EXIT NODE'S SYSOP KNOWING.</b>
</div>
Therefore, it's better to warn the .onion server's administrator with a simple email. You can also ask the 
node's administrator to be put in the exit policy.
<br>This way, the node won't be able to send or receive messages from your server or address.
</p>
<p><b>How is made the routing:</b><br>
The mail addresses coming out here have this syntax:<br>
<blockquote>username.<span class="gr">toraddress00000.onion</span>@domain.tld</blockquote>
This server removes the part after the character "@" and put the character "@" before the Tor network's 
address, then send the message via tor network.<br>
<blockquote>username@<span class="gr">toraddress00000.onion</span></blockquote>
When an email is going form the Tor network to the Internet , this server replace the character "@" 
with a dot "." and append at the end of the address a character "@" and the domain name of the server, 
then send the message via Internet.
</p>
<p><b>VMAT OnionMail Routing:</b><br>
The VMAT mail addresses sending like a normal mail address. The exit/enter router forward the message 
into the Tor network to the OnionMail network with a Virtual Mail Address Translation.<br>
There aren't simple ways to decode the mail address.</p>
<p><b>OnionMail servers security:</b><br>
OnionMail uses filesystem with strong cryptography and asymmetric keys. All users use GPG mail 
encryption. All cryptographic keys of the server are not into the server. All keys is sored in a 
tor cloud network and all keys are calculated via F(X) by other OnionMail servers. The self-destruction 
certificate can delete all F(X) seeds without access to the original server. Some trusted network check 
the SSL certificates and the servers security and identity.
<br>All systems are safe even in the event of theft, damage, tapping, tampering, also generating the 
appropriate alerts to users.
