OnionMail is an open source SMTP/POP3 compatible mail server with some functions 
designed for Tor hidden services. OnionMail use filesystem cryptography and some 
extended functions. This server also allows you to use the email in the tor 
network without losing the ability to communicate with the Internet.


        «In the future, maybe we will implement the anonymous coffee!
        Today, only OnionMail ;) »

Why OnionMail

    The real question is: «Why not???».
    OnionMail defends the right to confidentiality of communications.
    OnionMail prevents clandestine espionage “otherwise democratic” governments.

How it works?

    Usually other mail systems all mail messages pass through different SMTP 
    servers often the connection is not encrypted.
    With OnionMail the connection is always encrypted and the server does not 
    saving data to disk. Only the recipient's server stores the messages.

    The message files into the server are encrypted with asymmetric key, which 
    is encrypted with the password of the user and the server keys. In the event
    of theft, the system does not reveal any sensitive data.
    It always advisable to use PGP or GPG to encrypt e-mail messages.
    When a message is sent from the Internet it passes through the server 
    Enter / Exit. These servers are the entry and exit nodes of Tor for e-mail. 
    The user can choose which node to use to communicate to the internet.
    Spam is short-lived because there are the custom blacklists. So each user 
    can set their own spam filters.
    All servers are federated to create a check system for SSL server 
    certificates.
    With systems like this X-Keyscore and similar technologies have big problems
    to intercept your mail messages.


Rules of Use

        Messages with multiple recipients are not allowed.
        There aren't Delivery Status Notification. If there are any problems 
	email client responds with an error directly.
        The message headers are filtered.
        The hostname and ip addresses in the mail headers will be deleted or 
	replaced with [0.0.0.0].
        It compulsory to use TLS. (STARTTLS, SSL 2048 bits).
        You can manage the Blacklist and block individual addresses or entire 
	hidden service to block spam.
        The messages are automatically deleted after a number of days even if 
	unread.
        You can request services and information to the server by sending a 
	message to the server@xy ... z.onion
        Always follow the rules of the server. For more information please send 
	a message with subject RULEZ to your server.
        The SysOp, admin or root user can't read your private email messages.

How to use

    To use OnionMail you must use a Tor connection. We suggest to use Tails and 
    GPG or PGP to encrypt your email messages.
    To get your OnionMail use this page.

    There aren't any webmail to use your OnionMail. To read your email use the 
    POP3 with TLS protocol.
    (ClwawsMail and Thunderbrid supports this protocol).

    When you send an email to the internet your address is changed by the M.A.T. 
    (Mail Address Translator) protocol.
    The onion address in moved before the character "@" and is append after"@" 
    an intenret domain name of the exit/enter node.
    Example:
    If your mail address is: test@123456789abcef.onion
    The exit node is: onionmail.info
    The address will automatically translated: 
    	test.123456789abcef.onion@onionmail.info

    To use the servers services, send an email message to your server.
    The address of server is "server" and all the same before character "@" of 
    your OnionMail address.
    Example:
    If your mail address is: test@123456789abcef.onion
    Your server is: server@123456789abcef.onion

    The SysOp is the owner/administrator of the server. The address of sysop is 
    "sysop" and all the before character "@" of the server address.
    Example:
    Your SysOp mail address: sysop@123456789abcef.onion

    To use the server's services send an email message to the server, the 
    subject of the messages is used to select the function.
    Example:
    If you want tho read the server rules send a message to your server 
    (example server@123456789abcef.onion) with the subject "RULEZ"
    The server will reply to you with the rulez file.


How to activate an OnionMail account into the OnionMail's project deep network

        Generate a PGP key associated to an email or an existent OnionMail 
	address.
        Go to this page.
        Paste your PGP public key and enter your email (or current OnionMail) 
	address.
        Select the server. We suggest “ridot”.
        Choose the username.
        Click on the button “subscribe” and wait for 150/200 seconds. 
	Do not leave the page.
        Read your email. You will receive an encrypted message and account 
	informations.

Server Functions

    As described in the previous section, to use the server's functions send a 
    message to your server.

        Get server informations:
        Send a message to the sever width subject: IDENT
        The server will reply to the SSL and server informations.
        Manage your SPAM filters:
        To read the SPAM filters senda a message to the server width 
		subject: SPAM LIST
        To add an address the subject is: SPAM ADD maildaddress@xyz.onion
        To add an entire server the subject is: SPAM ADD *@spamexample.onion
        To remove an entry, read the number from SPAM LIST. 
		The subject is: SPAM DEL (number)
        Subscribe to a mailing list:
        Send a message to the mailing list's server 
		(server@ all the same after "@" of list address).
        The subject is: LIST example.list@serverlist.onion SUBSCRIBE
        Unsubscribe to a mailing list:
        Send a message to the mailing list's server 
		(server@ all the same after "@" of list address).
        The subject is: LIST example.list@serverlist.onion UNSUBSCRIBE
        Get the exit node list:
        The subject is: EXIT LIST
        To set the default exit node:
        The subject is: SET EXIT exitnode.example.org
        To get help, rules and manuals:
        The subject is: RULEZ
        Tho get the rulez file of a mailing list:
        Send a message to the mailing list's server 
		(server@ all the same after "@" of list address).
        The subject is: LIST example.list@serverlist.onion RULEZ
        To check your headers:
        The subject is: REBOUND HEADERS

How to activate a server

    To activate an OnionMail server you must use Tor and Java.
    We suggest to install cpulimit to prevent server CPU trouble when 
    OnionMail generates the keys.
    Don't create any exit server if don't know what you are doing:

        An OnionMail enter/exit server can associate the hidden service 
	onion address to the internet address.
        Do not create any user into the enter/exit server.

        The first step is: Create an hidden service:
        Create a directory, for example /home/onionmail/hiddenServiceDir
        Edit the /etc/tor/torrc file to add an hidden service:

            HiddenServiceDir /home/onionmail/hiddenServiceDir/

            HiddenServicePort 25 127.0.0.1:10025

            HiddenServicePort 110 127.0.0.1:10110

        Download OnionMail and extract it, for example in /home/onionmail
        Create the user and group for onionmail and set the files permissions.
        Restart tor and wait for the completion of tor bootstrap.
        Read the content of the file hostname into the hiddenServiceDir. 
		This is your .onion address.
        Edit the OnionMail configuration:
        Edit the file servers.conf ( /home/onionmail/etc/servers.conf )
        Modify the line "SMTPServer example {", after the word SMTPServer 
		replace "example" with a nickname of the server.
        Modify the parameter "Onion". This is the address of the hidden service 
		(put the content of the file hiddenServiceDir/hostname ).
        Modify the parameter "MailDir". This is the root directory of the server, 
		use an absolute path and do not create the directory. 
			( For example /home/onionmail/maildir ).
        Change the passwords: Parameter PassWD.
        Don't forget to modifiy the root password into the configuration file 
		control.conf ( /home/onionmail/etc/control.conf ).
        If you want tho create an exit/enter OnionMail server:
        Set the MX record of the enter/exit internet domain name of the server.
        Modify the file servers.conf into OnionMail config directory.
        Set the parameter "ExitRouteDomain" tho the internet domain name of the 
		server.
        Set the parameter "ServerType" to "exit".
        Set the parameter "SMTPPort" to 25. This is the SMTP port. 
		(Listen 0.0.0.0:25)
        Don't forget to set: HiddenServicePort 25 127.0.0.1:25 into the torrc file. 
		( /etc/tor/torrc ).
        Don't forget to modify the ssl infomations (SSLInfo) into the servers.conf file.
        How to create multiple servers:
        Modify the /etc/tor/torrc to create more hidden service and 
		hiddenServiceDir (directory).
        (Do not reuse the same ports).
        Add multiple server block into the servers.conf 
		( /home/onionmail/etc/servers.conf).
        (Copy and paste the first server block and change the copy).
        Generate the server:
        java -jar onionmail.jar --gen-servers
        Copy the files keyblock.txt and sysop.txt in a secure place 
		(not into the server machine!). Do this for each OnionMail server.
        Start the OnionMail server:
        java -jar onionmail.jar
        Paste the contents of keyblock.txt and server keyblock password (read sysop.txt).
        The content of keyblock.txt end with a line "."
        You can also use a little trick to daemonize OnionMail:
        Wipe the files keyblock.txt and sysop.txt. Create a single password file.
        java -jar onionmail.info < passwordfile &
        How to control the server:
        You can use the PHPOnionMail package or the API directly.
        To use the API connect via telnet:
        telnet 127.0.0.1 9100
        How to create a user manually:
        telnet 127.0.0.1 9100
        server nickname serverpassword
        addusr username
        quit
        The SysOp account:
        The user logon informations are into the sysop.txt
